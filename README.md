# Ticker chart

Simple tool for tickers monitoring

The service implements an example of generating realtime data. It returns new prices once per second for 100 artificial trading instruments: ticker_00, ticker_01, ..., ticker_99. Random deviations are used as a price change function for each instrument.

Ticker chart allows you to select a ticker using the drop-down list and display the price chart for the selected instrument from the initial moment, adding data as it becomes available.

The service is based on the following stack: Django as a backend framework, a PostgreSQL database, and the Chart.js frontend library for real-time price charting. The frontend and backend parts communicate using websockets.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

-   To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

-   To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy ticker_chart

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
